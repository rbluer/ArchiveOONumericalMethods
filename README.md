This archive contains the book of Didier Besset in its original form. 

The `OONumericalMethodsAsGiven` folder contains the original files.

The `NumericalMethods` folder contains a version fixed to rebuild the book using a modern LaTeX toolchain.

Based on it we prepared a new version without the Java code but it is hosted in another repository.


<hr />

The Java source has been cleaned up with the elimination of all compiler warnings and errors, and has been
place in the project's 'src' directory. The original LaTeX directories have not been touched.  The 
"other repository" is unknown at this time.

Using Gradle as the build tools.

Setting java 17 as the primary version.
